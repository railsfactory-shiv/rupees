Rupees

This is an extension of original project (https://github.com/railsfactory-shiv/rupees).

Using Rupees you can write number to words (as Indian rupee).

Following changes were done in this fork:
1. Spelling and case corrections.
2. Removed comma (,) and dot (.) from the output text.

This is easy and self explanatory.
